# ESPY

A python wrapper for simple ingests and queries of data.

## Quick start

**Note** Python 3.7 is required to use the `keyphrase` module for querying. There are polyfills that allow you to use 3.6, but those are not covered here.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`,
pass a dictionary to `ES#insert_bulk()`
